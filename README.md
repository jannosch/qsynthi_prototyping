# QSynthi Prototyping

Accompanying code for our paper that has been accepted at the ICAD 2025 (International Conference on Auditory Display).

Associated paper: "Interactive Sonification of 2D Quantum Systems" by Jannis MÃ¼ller, Arthur Freye and Thomas Hermann.


## Description

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and scripts for the research and development of an expansion to the Quantum Synthesizer QSynthi ([qsynthi.com](https://qsynthi.com)).

The follow-up project to QSynthi (working title "QSynth2" or stylised `QSynthII`) expands the core quantum simulation from 1D to 2D, allowing for the simulation of more complex quantum systems and application of many different sonification techniques.

The examples shown in our paper are generated with these notebooks. They are also available here in the folder `results/paper_examples/`.
